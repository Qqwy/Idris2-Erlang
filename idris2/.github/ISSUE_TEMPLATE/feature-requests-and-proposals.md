Experience with Idris 1 suggests that feature requests and proposals tend to get buried among the bug reports in the issue tracker, even if we tag the effectively. Partly this is because there's not many people working on Idris full time (it's about half a person at the moment)

So, instead, please add the details on the wiki, at https://github.com/edwinb/Idris2/wiki/Contributions-wanted, which I hope will be more discoverable. It's also a good idea to suggest it on the mailing list and/or the IRC channel.
