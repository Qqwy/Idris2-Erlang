Please check INSTALL.md and README.md to ensure you have all the required dependencies. In particular, you need at least Idris 1.3.2 to build Idris 2, and a version of Chez Scheme compiled with threading support (this is the default in most distributions) in order to run the tests successfully.

Otherwise, please describe the problem, including any relevant parts of build logs, and describing as much about your environment as possible.
