Experience with Idris 1 suggests that larger feature requests and proposals tend to get buried among the bug reports in the issue tracker, even if we tag the effectively. Partly this is because there's not many people working on Idris full time (it's about half a person at the moment), but also, it's because it's not objectively clear how to resolve such issues.

So, instead, please add the details on the wiki, at https://github.com/edwinb/Idris2/wiki/Contributions-wanted, which I hope will be more discoverable. It's also a good idea to suggest it on the mailing list and/or the IRC channel, which are good places for more detailed discussion.
